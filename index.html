      <h2> Map Based Visualisation</h2>
      <p> 
        The map based visualisation below shows the global nuclear explosions that have occured on Earth up 
        until 2000 and the strength of the explosion is measured in KiloTons (KT) of TNT explosion. <br><br>
        
        Nuclear explosions consist mainly 50% of Blast Energy, 35% Thermal Energy and 15% Nuclear Radiation.
        A blast strength is measured as yield which is the addition of blast energy and thermal energy.   

        Please use the Zoom and Map Centre icons to adjust the map view to see where various nuclear blasts occured.

      <h2> Line Chart over Time Visualisation </h2>
      <p>
        The line chart below shows the trend & count of how many nuclear weapons have been made cumulative to that particular year. <br>
        It is evident that production started growing rapidly during the cold-war (1947-1991) due to political tensions.

      <h2> Heat Map Table Visualisation </h2>
      <p>
        The Heat Map table below shows that majority of the nuclear bombs on average have a lower average blast strength.
        <br>
        This maybe due to majority of the bombs deployed for testing purposes and demonstration of power as shown by the Nts(Nevada Testing Site) used by USA 
        and Semi Kazakh used by USSR. Which leads back to the cold-war between the two nations who were trying to outdo each other due to
        poltical differences after the end of WWII.

      <h2> Bar & Pie Chart Visualisation </h2>
      <p>
        The bar chart shows that majority of the weapons have been created by the major powers of the world before 2000.
        We can see that China & USSR (political allies) and Western Powers (USA, UK, FRANCE) contributed to majority of the nuclear weapons made.
        <br>
        We have excluded India and Pakistan as they only made a few nuclear weapons prior to 2000. Although, recently more countries have joined
        the list of nuclear powers. For the legend on the right provided for the pie chart PNE means (Peaceful Nuclear Explosion), SAM(Surface-to-air missile), FMS(Foreign Military Sales)
